//! `meadow` is an experimental robotics-focused publish/request middleware
//! for embedded Linux. It uses a star-shaped network topology, with a focus
//! on ease-of-use and transparent design and operation. It is more similar to
//! [`ZeroMQ`](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter1/) than to higher-level frameworks like [ROS/2](https://design.ros2.org/articles/discovery_and_negotiation.html),
//! but uses a central coordination process similar to [MOOS-IvP](https://oceanai.mit.edu/ivpman/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Helm.HelmDesignIntro#section2.4).
//! Meadow currently supports the following messaging patterns:
//!
//! | Protocol | Publish   | Request    | Subscribe |
//! |----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
//! | TCP      | **X**     | **X**      | **X**     |
//! | UDP      | **X**     |            |           |
//!
